# AWS AppConfig CLI

**NOTE: This is still early in development**

> CLI tool for working with AWS AppConfig

This tool is designed to make working with [AWS AppConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/what-is-appconfig.html) a little easier. The default API, and therefore the [AWS SDK's and CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/appconfig/index.html) tools rely on knowledge of obscure ID's to reference applications, profiles, environments etc. This CLI allows you to use the familiar names of these components as well as simplifying the interface to AppConfig.
